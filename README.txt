Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) customized for Beyond Z
=======
This project is take the Moodle.org project and create a custom theme for Beyond Z.  We don't have any front-end devs/designers on the team yet, so if you have the skillz and want to help we would love for you to take a stab at it!

Here is a document with some sample marketing/branding collateral to use for inspiration #TODO: insert doc with marketing assets#

For context on the organization, please see the one pager under: moodle\beyondz\Beyond Z One Pager.pdf

For more information or to brainstorm, please email brian.sadler@beyondz.org

QUICK INSTALL
=============

For the impatient, here is a basic outline of the
installation process, which normally takes me only
a few minutes:

1) Move the Moodle files into your web directory.

2) Create a single database for Moodle to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser, you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Moodle, creating an admin account etc.

4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so.

Good luck and have fun!
